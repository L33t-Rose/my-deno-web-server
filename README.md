# My Own Web Server
Built in Deno

This is a basic project where I explore how web servers work. 
What I hope to learn:
* Ins and Outs of HTTP
  - What are the various HTTP Headers and how do I use them
  - How do I use HTTP
* Understanding what a web server is and it how serves data to users
  - How do I server content through different paths
  - What is inside a request body and how do I react accordingly to that request body?
* What it's like to work in Deno


How to run web server(in terminal):
```
deno run --allow-net --allow-read test.ts
```
